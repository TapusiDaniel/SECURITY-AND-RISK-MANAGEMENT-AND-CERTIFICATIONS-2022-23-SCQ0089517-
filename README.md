# SECURITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND CERTIFICATIONS 2022-2023 (SCQ0089517)

  This GitHub repository houses materials and projects related to the Information Security course I attended at the University of Padova during the 2022/2023 academic year. It includes my assessment project for Verizon Telecommunications.

## Course Overview

  The Information Security course at the University of Padova aims to equip students with the necessary skills to effectively manage and secure information systems. Throughout the course, we explored various risk identification strategies and security management techniques, focusing on both theoretical frameworks and practical implementations. The curriculum was designed to deepen our understanding of the security landscape, emphasizing the importance of certifications and standards in the field.

## Examination and Assessment

  The course assessment was based on a comprehensive exam that tested our knowledge of all the topics covered. The evaluation criteria focused on our understanding and ability to apply the concepts in real-world scenarios.

## About the Document: Verizon Assessment Report

  In the document `Verizon.docx`, I conducted a detailed cybersecurity assessment for Verizon Telecommunications using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. This report analyzes several critical security domains within the organization, highlighting areas of strength and suggesting improvements where necessary.

## Document Overview

  In the comprehensive assessment of Verizon Telecommunications' cybersecurity posture through the NIST CSF 1.1 framework, several critical areas have been identified that require immediate attention to enhance overall security and operational reliability. The analysis highlighted significant gaps in asset management, particularly the need for better tracking and protection of sensitive data and resources. Additionally, deficiencies in access control measures expose Verizon to risks of unauthorized access and potential data breaches, which could compromise customer trust and corporate integrity.

  The lack of a robust cybersecurity training program for employees and external stakeholders further exacerbates the risk, making the organization more susceptible to human-error-induced security incidents. Furthermore, the current anomaly detection strategies are inadequate for the early identification of potential threats, delaying response times.

  Recovery planning was also found to be lacking in structure and integration, potentially leading to prolonged service disruptions in the event of cyber incidents. This could have severe financial and reputational consequences for Verizon.

  To address these vulnerabilities, it is recommended that Verizon implements a tiered improvement strategy, aiming for a "Repeatable" level of implementation across all control areas. This includes establishing a systematic inventory management for assets, enhancing access controls, developing comprehensive cybersecurity training programs, refining anomaly detection processes, and integrating recovery planning into the overall incident management framework.

  By taking these steps, Verizon can significantly bolster its cybersecurity defenses, reduce the likelihood of successful cyber attacks, and ensure the resilience and reliability of its services in the face of growing cyber threats. These enhancements will not only protect the company's assets but also solidify the trust and confidence of its customers and partners.
